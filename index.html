        <h2>What on earth is tail recursion?</h2>
<p>Tail recursion is a special form of recursion that can be optimised by a compiler to run much like iteration. A function is <em>tail recursive</em> if the final operation that the function performs is the recursive call.</p>
<p>Tail recursion is a special form of <em>tail call</em>. A tail call is any function call that occurs at the very end of a function. Since there is no more work to be done by the caller, a compiler can perform a <em>tail call opimisation</em> so that the called function can replace the stack frame of the caller, rather than create a new one. The called function will return directly to the <em>original</em> caller. This optimisation of non-recursive tail calls typically saves little time and space, because there are not that many such tail calls. However, in functions where recursion happens through a tail call, this <em>tail recursion elimination</em> becomes very worthwhile. Additionally, this is slightly simpler than tail call optimisation to implement for a compiler, because it can simply implement a <code>GOTO</code> that returns control to the top of the tail recursive function, rather than requiring special knowledge of another function's internal structure.</p>
<p>(Strictly speaking, tail call optimisation does not necessarily have to replace the caller's stack frame with the callee's but, rather, guarantees that an unbounded number of calls in tail position require only a bounded amount of space.)</p>
<h2>So what does it look like?</h2>
<p>Consider a regular recursive implementation of a factorial function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def fact(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * fact(n - 1)
</code></pre>
<p>Let us observe what happens when <code>fact(3)</code> is called. Firstly, a <em>stack frame</em> is created for <code>fact(3)</code> on the call stack. Then, since <code>3 != 0</code>, it calls <code>fact(2)</code> (which creates a new stack frame) and waits for a result so that it can multiply this with <code>3</code>. Similarly, <code>fact(2)</code> calls <code>fact(1)</code>, and <code>fact(1)</code> calls <code>fact(0)</code>, at which point this accumulation of stack frames ceases. Now, the stack has to <em>unwind</em>, returning a result to <code>fact(3)</code> which calculates its result, and subsequently returns this to its caller.</p>
<p>Now, consider a tail recursive implementation of the same function:</p>
<p>(Note: I'm using Python because it's basically pseudocode, but Python <strong>does not support tail call optimisation</strong>, so this example can overflow the stack in Python.)</p>
<pre><code>def fact_tail_rec(n):
    return fact_helper(n, 1)
    
def fact_helper(n, acc):
    if n == 0:
        return acc
    return fact_helper(n - 1, acc * n)
</code></pre>
<p>Observe the pattern used in the helper function — there is an <em>accumulator</em>. This parameter is what gets built up so that at the base case it is returned. Tail recursive functions use an accumulator so that a value can be immediately returned, rather than having to unwind the stack and perform further computation.</p>
<p>The accumulator's initial value is typically an <em>identity</em> with respect to some operation. For example, in our <code>fact</code> function, the accumulator begins at 1, because 1 is the multiplicative identity, whereas a tail recursive summation function would likely use 0, the additive identity.</p>
<h2>Tail recursion and iteration</h2>
<p>When I first wrote a tail recursive function, it didn't feel like a <em>proper</em> recursive function, because it was keeping track of state from outside the function (in the accumulator). In fact, that was because any function written using tail recursion is semantically equivalent to iteration. (In fact, in some functional languages like Scheme, tail recursion is the basic iteration mechanism.)</p>
<p>This is (unrigorously) because any iterative code of the form</p>
<pre><code>def f():
    while A:
        B
    return C
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>A</code> and <code>C</code> are expressions and <code>B</code> is a sequence of statements, can be expressed using tail recursion as</p>
<pre><code>def f():
    if A:
        B
        return f()
    else:
        return C
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the tail recursive call does not have to be lexically at the bottom of the function, it just has to be the last operation performed by the function.</p>
<h2>Why use tail recursion?</h2>
<p>You might not actually want tail recursion. Firstly, the language you use might not support it. For example, <a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2009/04/tail-recursion-elimination.html">Python does not</a> and ECMAScript 6 guarantees tail call optimisation but many JavaScript engines do not support it. Secondly, iteration is perfectly fine, and a much safer option in most languages. Thirdly, tail call optimisation is incompatible with nice stack traces because stack frames are overwritten, which can lead to inadvertently recursive functions becoming difficult to debug.</p>
<p>On the other hand, tail recursion means that a recursive function can run in <em>O(1)</em> stack space, which means that you can perform an indefinite amount of recursive calls without causing a stack overflow. Tail recursion can also provide a more subjectively elegant solution, and some extremely pure functional languages may not offer iteration. However, in general, good advice is to use iteration to avoid the hassle of figuring out whether or not tail call optimisation is guaranteed.</p>

        <h3>Source files: <a href="https://github.com/sidney-pham/sbhs-login-screen">sidney-pham/sbhs-login-screen</a></h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>There was an appeal for SBHS students some time around November 2017 to design the new login page for the SBHS Intranet Portal, which was being revamped (unnecessarily, I thought). I spent a late night designing the following login screen, submitted it for approval and faced some demurral from the &quot;specially trained hamster&quot; in charge of IT, and eventually had the design rejected in favour of what I still think is <a href="https://login.sbhs.net.au/">a far inferior design</a> (assuming they haven't updated it since the time of writing). Oh well. At least this was the subject of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/harry.jinghan.wu/posts/203243866887177">a legendary Harry Wu rant</a>.</p>
<h3>What I wrote at the time...</h3>
<p>The requirements didn't really specify much about the actual design of the page itself, but quite a bit about the technology used. I inferred that the desired modifications to the design included:</p>
<ol>
<li>An image-based background. (This seemed the most obvious difference between the <a href="http://student.sbhs.net.au/images/stories/intranet/student/NewLoginScreen.png">proposed design</a> and the <a href="https://login.sbhs.net.au">current login screen</a>).</li>
<li>A more modern/less boring design. The current design is white on black and uses standard UI elements (e.g., <code>input[type=submit]</code> without styling).</li>
<li>Room for extensibility in the design (potentially). If a link like 'Forgot password' were to be added to the design (as hinted at in the proposed screenshot), it would be kind of hard to work this into the existing design.</li>
<li>Maybe making the HTML/CSS less bad? It wasn't <em>terrible</em> to start with but it sure didn't use Flexbox!</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Result</h3>
<p>I ended up with a single design that I think looks great. It's modern, clean, extensible and hackless. The main problem with it is that it revolves <em>entirely</em> around someone having a high-res version of the image I found on the school website <a href="http://www.sydneyboyshigh.com/school/introduction/overview">here</a>. The image is perfect for use here -- the sky is clear and looks just like solid sky-blue (which is very conveniently one of the school colours). It's mildly oversaturated but I think it works very nicely in the design's favour here. In the case that no such high-res image exists, I think it would be a good idea for someone to try and take a new photograph of the façade. It would be important here to ensure that the sky-blue in the navbar is replicated and a similar saturation be applied.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sidney-pham.github.io/sbhs-login-screen/sbhs-login.html">Suggested screen</a>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xhwy29v.jpg" alt="Screen" />
<ul>
<li>This is the suggested design. The title-bar at the top is basically a navbar without buttons (you can add links pretty easily, it uses Flexbox). The fact that it's transparent makes it so much cooler.</li>
<li>The title-bar originally said 'Sydney Boys High School Intranet Portal' but it did seem overly lengthy, and shortening it makes it much nicer on mobile displays. Might be swapped out for 'Intranet Portal' if desired.</li>
<li>The actual <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> of the HTML page is the same as that of the old design, but I think it's too lengthy. Might be worth thinking of a new title.</li>
<li>The title-bar provides a link back to the school website, which seems to be a piece of desired functionality hinted at in the proposed design.</li>
<li>The actual form was surprisingly hard to design. It's really hard to redesign something that's already pretty decent. I got rid of <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>s in favour of placeholders which look much more modern.</li>
<li>The old design took three lines to basically just say 'Log in to the Sydney Boys High School Intranet Portal.' I shortened it down into two lines because having just a single line looks a bit empty and overly minimalistic (not something for which the current Sydney Boys High School website is reputed, so would be visually aberrant).</li>
<li>There's a <code>3px</code> <code>border-radius</code> around the white box because I felt sharp edges made it a bit too clean a design. The <code>border-radius</code> makes it slightly more approachable, but it's not enough to make it feel cheap either.</li>
<li>I placed the 'Parent Registration' and Help links on new lines below the submit button for extensibility. If there's a new page to be added, it can be added without worrying too much about breaking the design.</li>
<li>The Help button should probably be replaced with either text ('Help') or maybe an SVG icon, but the actual textual content of the page isn't really for me to decide.</li>
<li>The current font stack is just the GitHub system font stack. I designed it using 'Lato', which I think looks great here, but it could easily be construed as a bit too playful for use on a website belonging to an educational institution. Unfortunately I don't have enough devices to test how well the GitHub font stack holds up, but it can't be <em>that</em> bad.</li>
<li>The image background is covered on mobile displays because the desktop design is too elaborate for a small display. Testing using Chrome DevTools seems to suggest the design scales from 'a VGA-resolution phone to a 5k screen' rather well.</li>
<li>I used a couple of HTML5 attributes like <code>required</code> that might help with client-side form validation. The Constraint API/HTML5 Validation should probably be used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://sidney-pham.github.io/sbhs-login-screen/sbhs-login-error.html">Suggested screen showing errors</a>
<ul>
<li>This is the same screen but with the error and styling that appears when a user unsuccessfully attempts to log in.</li>
<li>A new paragraph with the class <code>login-error-message</code> is added. This can be achieved by inserting a new DOM node or just toggling a class that toggles <code>display: block/none;</code>.</li>
<li>The class <code>login-error-form</code> needs to be added to the <code>#login-form</code> to enable the crimson borders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://sidney-pham.github.io/sbhs-login-screen/sbhs-login-centred-titlebar.html">Centred titlebar</a>
<ul>
<li>This is just the suggested design but with the transparent title-bar centred instead of on the left. I prefer the suggested design, obviously, and I think this makes it too <em>proper</em> for a website. (I think the symmetry makes it look too much like a painting).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://sidney-pham.github.io/sbhs-login-screen/sbhs-login-blue-titlebar.html">Blue titlebar</a>
<ul>
<li>In the case that there is hesitation to use the transparent title-bar, the title-bar can be made blue which makes it feel just like a standard navbar/title-bar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://sidney-pham.github.io/sbhs-login-screen/sbhs-login-box-shadow.html">A bit of <code>box-shadow</code></a>
<ul>
<li>The white box is given a <code>box-shadow</code> to make it pop off the page. I'm not really too much of a fan of designs that pretend to be 3D (e.g., Material Design).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://sidney-pham.github.io/sbhs-login-screen/sbhs-login-text-shadow.html">A bit of <code>text-shadow</code></a>
<ul>
<li>The text in the transparent title-bar is given a slight <code>text-shadow</code> to make it (potentially) easier to read?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

        <p><strong><em>'Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single element.'</em></strong></p>
<p>There are two intuitive (but inefficient) solutions. You could sort the array, then compare consecutive elements. Alternatively, you could use a set:</p>
<pre><code>set = Set()
for item in array:
  if item in set:
    set.remove(item)
  else:
    set.add(item)
return set.pop()
</code></pre>
<p>But a cooler way to do it is:</p>
<pre><code>result = 0
for item in array:
  result ^= item
return result
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>^</code> is the XOR operator. This works because of the commutativity of XOR. Spooky stuff.</p>
